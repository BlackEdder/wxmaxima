- Add error output pane (similar to the hist plane, but uneditable)
-	Redirect errors to here if it is present (make sure not to redirect "is a positive?")
- Add message that says warns if one or more errors are found in the main window

Non error handling related:
- Make the output more keyboard friendly (i.e. select with keyboard, home on a long line
	etc)
